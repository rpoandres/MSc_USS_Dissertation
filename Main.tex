\chapter{Introduction} \label{Chap1}

\section{Background}

The first announcement of the construction of Bogota's future metro system was on XXXXXX by XXXX. On several occasions, the need for a higher-capacity public transportation system in Colombia's capital has taken great attention from the general public. The initial idea of building a metro in Bogot\'{a} goes back to the year 1942 when the current mayor at the time suggested the building of a new metro system as the functioning trolley car was highly demanded \citep{metrodebogotaHistoriaMetroBogota2011}. The previous versions of the project were unsuccessful in terms of their execution and compilation, however, each attempt reinforced the need of improving Bogota's public transportation system.

The scale and dimension of Colombia's capital, Bogot\'{a} can be measured from multiple angles. Population-wise, with 7.9 million people, it is the country's biggest city and accounts for 15\% of the country's total population, as Medell\'{i}n and Cali take second and third place with 5\% and 4\% of the total population, respectively \citep{daneProyeccionesPoblacionPopulation2023}. Regarding the city's economic role, it is the biggest economic hub with 25\% of the nation's GDP, followed similarly as in the population distribution by Medell\'{i}n and Cali, with 6\% and 4\%, respectively \citep{daneCuentasNacionalesDepartamentales2023}.

Reference to BRT

By September 2016, the local and national governments finally materialized their intentions in a formal agreement to support the development of the metro project which led to the ongoing construction process that started in 2021. The project consists of the construction of the first of two future metro lines. The scope of this research will only include the first metro line in the future scenario as the final designs of the second metro line have not been published yet. 

The first metro line will have a 23,9-kilometre length overground track with 16 stations. With an investment of 12,95 billion COP (4,33\footnote{September 2017 average COP/USD rate: 2.991,42 \citep{bancodelarepublicaTasaCambioRepresentativa2023}} billion USD), the construction of the first line began in 2021 and is supposed to be finished by 2028.


% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Lack of functioning metro system in Bogota although it has been proposed and mention in previous local and/or national government plans
% \end{itemize}

\section{Importance}

The improvement of the current transport infrastructure system in Colombia's capitals aims to impact a significant share of Bogot\'{a}'s population, as 1 in every 3 trips in the city relies on public transportation. According to Bogot\'{a} City Council, BRT is the primary mode of commuting, with 4,8 million trips a day \citep{alcaldiadebogotaEncuestaMovilidad20192019}. From the total of 13.4 million daily trips, BRT accounts for 36\% total trips, followed by walking\footnote{Pedestrian trips with length greater or equal to 15 minutes} and privately owned cars, with 24\% and 15\% of total trips, respectively.

\item Brief intro to Bogota as a city and centre of economic and decision-making processes
\item How does it contribute or prevent people to have better life quality

\chapter{Literature review} \label{Chap2}

\section{Modelling in the urban context}

The use of modelling tools in the urban environment has gained popularity for analyzing high-complexity topics to support the decision-making process \citep{houApproachBuildingOccupancy2020}. As urban theories can be represented in mathematical models, the use of simulation processes allows researchers to experiment with possible outcomes in future urban scenarios \citep{battyUrbanModeling2009a}.

Regarding the urban modelling process as a discipline both, \cite{battyUrbanModeling2009a} and \cite{wilsonFutureUrbanModelling2018}, presented past references to grasp a general notion of its historic evolution. On one hand, \cite{battyUrbanModeling2009a} stated how the first formal contributions on the topic go back to \cite{alonsoLocationLandUse1964}, the basis of the so-called new urban economics. Batty included a model-building process overview listing the main scientific and mathematics principles to consider. On the other hand, \cite{wilsonScienceCitiesRegions2012} highlighted the influence of \cite{lowryModelMetropolis1964} as a milestone in the urban modelling evolution and uses it as an example to explain urban modelling together with a full historical review of the field.

Taking \cite{battyUrbanModeling2009a} and \cite{wilsonFutureUrbanModelling2018} as references, the urban models can be grouped into three main categories: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Land-use transportation: Conceptually based on the gravitational model \citep{battyUrbanModellingAlgorithms1976}, it aims to predict the spatial interaction (flows) between land use, economic activity and the inherent transportation costs of spatial units within the area of study. Leveraging on the principles of Newton's model, these models forecast how spatial units would  interact with one another considering the cost of interaction and attractiveness between them.
  \item Urban dynamics: Built on the principles used in ecological dynamic models and system dynamics, the urban dynamics models intend to derive through time the aggregate future dynamic activity or state that may result within an urban system.
  \item Cellular automata and agent-based modelling: They aim to simulate the emergent aggregate result of individual agent-level actions in a system, as agents interact with both the environment and other agents.
  \item Network analysis: It allows to study of the connections patterns that may arise between components to systematically assess the collective behaviour of components as a whole \citep{newmanNetworksIntroduction2010}.
\end{enumerate}

With the emergence of computational modelling, \cite{battyUrbanModeling2009a} described how it allowed urban theories to be deployed in an experimental digital environment. As theoretical knowledge can be represented in mathematical models, the use of simulation processes allowed researchers to experiment with hypothetical circumstances and produce possible outcomes in future urban scenarios \citep{battyUrbanModeling2009a}.

% Refernce to the futuro portraid by Wilson

In a more prospective and industry-related exercise, \cite{wilsonFutureUrbanModelling2018} presented his view on how urban modelling will develop and prosper in the future. Regarding tools and the inputs to further urban modelling development, \cite{wilsonFutureUrbanModelling2018} mentioned how big data and technological advancements will enable new capacities and new input data to apply modelling in the urban context. Apart from the already relatively well-developed urban modelling tools designed for transport assessment and retail location intelligence, \cite{wilsonFutureUrbanModelling2018} listed other industries that could expand the use of spatial modelling to support their location decision-making processes. Among the high-use modelling potential situations, \cite{wilsonFutureUrbanModelling2018} mentioned the energy sector, global trading models and the defence and security industry.

% Move to other section
% Technological information developments for the last decades have enabled greater capture, storing and processing capacities \citep{krainesIntegratingDistributedComputational2011}, a more multidisciplinary and robust approach is now available when addressing built environment-related phenomena. 

Given these points, it was highlighted by \cite{battyUrbanModeling2009a} and \cite{wilsonFutureUrbanModelling2018} how these modelling tools hold great value for both policymakers and private parties, as they manage to integrate theoretical constructs or business strategies and put them to the test through computational modelling \citep{battyUrbanModeling2009a}. Either from a public, private or research perspective, modelling tools applied to the urban context could provide decision-makers with new innovative insights and possible solutions to the numerous challenges that cities and society currently face across the globe.

Furthermore, \cite{battyUrbanModeling2009a} clarified that apart from the computational models above mentioned, GIS-based models are also part of the urban modelling domain and will be described in the next section of the present document.

% Mention to the groups described by Batty, complemented with the ones described by Clarke's article




% which included the main model types, their applications and future uses for urban policy-making. 



% In order to deploy these state-of-the-art computational tools on the subject of interest, data is required. Apart from the underlying theory of the model, data that intends to capture the topic of interest is essential to leverage computational models to contribute to urban-related topics. The expansion of urban modelling is highly related to the data availability to use as input in the simulation process. Luckily, there have been enormous

\section{Geographic information system}

Geographic information can be defined as the result of combining non-spatial data with their location in space. \cite{longleyGeographicInformationScience2015} defined geographic information as data that represents the 'what' and the 'where' features of anything. The 'what' component of the data would account for the attributes or non-spatial data captured and the 'when' is responsible for holding the coordinates that symbolise a specific location on earth.

According to \cite{maclachlanAppliedGeographicInformation2022} geographic information can be divided into two main data types:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Vector: Geographic vector data typically includes points, lines, polygons and grids.
  \item Raster: The raster format consists of a set of cell grids in which each cell holds a specific value. 
\end{enumerate}

To illustrate the use of geographic data, figure \ref{fig:Fig_data_types} shows the fashion in which data type can deliver a fair representation of the real world, through the use of both vector and raster data.

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{Images/Fig_Types_Geodata.png}
    \caption{Vector and raster geographical representation \citep{saabConceptualizingSpaceMapping2003}}
    \label{fig:Fig_data_types}
\end{figure}


% Include image of types of data: Look in \cite{longleyGeographicInformationScience2015} or use image from Andys book

The main use of geographic information is to represent the relative locations of features through a schematic and visual geographic model. With a certain level of abstraction, detail and scale, geographic modelling (mapping) produces knowledge related to the location and the features of the subject of study \citep{longleyGeographicInformationScience2015}. Hence, a geographic information system (GIS), consists of the systematic collection of geo-referenced attribute data. Gifted with powerful processing capabilities, 'GI systems are computer-based tools for collecting, storing, processing, analyzing, and visualizing geographic information' \citep{longleyGeographicInformationScience2015}.

% Reference to urban modelling for transport

As computing does in most cases, computer-based GIS offers the capacity of processing data in a fraction of the time that would take if is performed manually. Similarly, the generation and capture capacity of location-related attributes has widespread \citep{longleyGeographicInformationScience2015}, as the use of digital means has expanded to support all kinds of services and activities. The conjunctions of these two circumstances are aligned with the future scenario portrayed by \cite{wilsonFutureUrbanModelling2018} with the use of urban modelling covering new unattended spatial modelling and analysis need.



In that sense, the location of activities, infrastructure, points of interest or any kind of subject that includes location attributes can serve as input in the urban modelling process to test location-sensitive scenarios.
