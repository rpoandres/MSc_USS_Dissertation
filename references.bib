  abstract = {The new integrated transit system of Bogota (ITSB) is a local initiative to improve general transportation conditions in the city. However, as an integral intervention to improve current transit services, it affects travel times and user costs entailing changes in accessibility. We developed a methodology to calculate these changes for different areas in the city, considering travel expenditure for work trips and socioeconomic features of the population. The paper evaluates accessibility implications for different fare schemes for the ITSB, modelling accessibility as a function of total travel expenditure and travel times. We focus on analysing changes in cost and trip distribution for ITSB routes and their impacts on access to employment. Changes in travel attributes are obtained from a four-step transport model of Bogota developed with VISUM modelling software. Meaningful changes in travel time and expenditure were found for all scenarios altering accessibility considerably. Under a flat fare scenario independent of travel distances, the number of transfers had a higher effect on accessibility in comparison to schemes where transfers are penalized through an incremental fare.},

  abstract = {The Metrocable in Medell\'in, Colombia, is an innovative system to improve access to deprived areas located in hilly zones. The idea to use cable cars as feeders to the metro was integrated into an ambitious urban project that, to date, has improved accessibility dramatically for some low-income residents. Using data before and after the project's implementation, we evaluate the impact on social equity for the population in the zone of influence, considering changes in accessibility to employment and in housing-related costs. The access provided by the project to the main high-employment centres has doubled the number of opportunities that can be reached by the ``target population,'' even though travel-time savings and costs have seen only small changes. In fact, prior access to the CBD was poor and expensive, but time and costs were reduced with the Metrocable, although this reduction was not equal for all locations in the metropolitan area. In general, we argue that the main benefits, in terms of accessibility that differentiates the areas analysed from those used for comparison, are related to a localised ease of access to specific centres of activity according to the centralised development of the city's job market along the mass transit lines. In terms of housing costs, we developed a set of difference-in-difference models that considered rent, transport, and public utilities costs; however, none of them have allowed us to conclude that there was a statistically valid relationship between the Metrocable and the changes in costs between the two analysed populations.},

These large, city-wide transportation projects are often central to larger urban revitalization plans intending to foster economic growth and alter city images to both residents and to outsiders. Crucial to the success of such ambitions is a system that provides equitable access to all residents and one that provides access to a large number of urban opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to explore the spatial accessibility landscape created by newly implemented BRT system in Cali, Colombia in terms of both access to the system itself and access to three distinct activities around the city. In particular, the equitable distribution of accessibility patterns is explored in relation to neighborhood socio-economic strata. Findings indicate that walking access to the BRT system is greatest for middle income groups and most limited for neighborhoods in the highest and lowest socio-economic strata. Accessibility values to activities are largely bound to the spatial distribution pattern of activities; most equitable for intentionally dispersed recreation site, and least for spatially clustered hospitals.},

This paper is based on data collected over a period of time more than a year utilizing GPS devices. More than 18 million readings were collected corresponding to operational characteristics of car, taxi, motorcycle, truck and different modalities of public transport (UPT). The proposed methodology was applied through the mobility plan of the city of Manizales (Colombia) during the year of 2011. Manizales is a medium sized city with approximately 360.000 inhabitants, located in the central range of the Colombian mountains The average operating speed on each street network arc is the primary analysis variable; Geostatistical techniques are applied to predict the average travel time of each transportation mode . The results obtained are shown graphically and correspond to current city mobility data in a manner permitting comparison between transportation modes. It is concluded that the taxi mode of transportation with respect to accessibility provides better accessibility followed in corresponding order by motorcycle, car, truck and finally UPT; it has been determined that UPT provides the worst global accessibility media conditions; however, the UPT is the mode of transport most frequently used by the population (75\% of daily trips).},

Building on consolidated methodologies for the assessment of potential accessibility, we estimate accessibility indicators at the zone level, evaluate how potential accessibility varies among income groups, and present evidence related to transport mode, in order to analyze social and spatial inequalities produced by the distribution of accessibility to employment and education activities. The research incorporates a method to evaluate how accessibility varies among zones according to average income and mode of transport in order to produce evidence-based arguments that can inform transport policy in the city-region of Bogot\'a, and other similar contexts in the Global South. Our results show strong distributional effects of the socio-spatial and economic structure of the city-region, its transport infrastructure and services, and the effect of current transport and land-use policies for citizens of different income groups. The tools and empirical evidence in this research seek to contribute to informed policy development in Latin America and other developing contexts, and feeding current debates on the role of accessibility in addressing social and spatial inequalities stemming from urban mobility.},

However, the consequences of such measures on activity and mobility patterns among social groups in Global South cities remain unclear. This paper seeks to provide reliable evidence from changes in behaviors across income groups at the urban scale. We report a detailed analysis from a web-based survey to understand the effects of the early and complete lockdown adopted to contain the COVID-19 spread on activity and travel patterns in Bogot\'a. We also performed a geographical proximity analysis of non-work services and facilities located around surveyed households to challenge the rhetoric about the `15-minute' city. We found that low-income people are more socially exposed to contagion being forced to go out to find their daily sustenance and having adverse economic and travel effects than other income groups. However, even though Bogot\'a is not so far from meeting the goal of 15~min proximity, particularly for non-work-related activities, we found marked inequalities among income groups regarding access to essential services in proximity. The paper's findings serve as a reminder that travel behavior and accessibility are not the remits of only urban transport planning and that land-use and urban planning play a determining role in redressing social and spatial inequalities in a city.},

Novel analytical practices promise smoother decision-making as part of a more evidence-based and smarter urbanism, while critical voices highlight the dangers and pitfalls of instrumental, data-driven city making to urban governance. Less attention has been devoted to identifying the practical conditions under which big data can realistically contribute to addressing urban policy problems. In this paper, we discuss the value and limitations of big data for long-term urban policy and planning. We first develop a theoretical perspective on urban analytics as a practice that is part of a new smart urbanism. We identify the particular tension of opposed temporalities of high-frequency data and the long dur\'ee of structural challenges facing cities. Drawing on empirical studies using big urban data, we highlight epistemological and practical challenges that arise from the analysis of high-frequency data for strategic purposesand formulate propositions on the ways in which urban analytics can inform long-term urban policy.},

  abstract = {The achievement of good spatial accessibility and equity in the distribution of urban services is one of the supreme goals for urban planners. With Scottish Government backing, the City of Edinburgh Council (CEC) has started to construct a tram network to cater for the future needs of Scotland's capital city by providing an integrated transport solution using trams and buses. Spatial Network Analysis of Public Transport Accessibility (SNAPTA) which is a GIS-based accessibility model has been developed to measure the accessibility by public transport to different urban services and activities. The model responds to several limitations in other existing accessibility models in planning practice. It offers an alternative and practical tool to help planners and decision makers in examining the strengths and weaknesses of land use \textendash{} transport integration. SNAPTA has been applied to a pilot study in Edinburgh city to identify the contribution of the infrastructure improvements of the tram system and Edinburgh South Suburban Railway (ESSR) to improved accessibility by public transport to six types of activity opportunities. This paper outlines the concept and methodology of the SNAPTA model, and presents the findings related to this pilot study with a focus on changes in potential accessibility to jobs between four different public transport network scenarios. The accessibility values so obtained help to identify the gaps in the coverage of the public transport network and the efficiency in the spatial distribution of urban services and activities. The findings focus on whether the planned transport infrastructures for Edinburgh will lead to better accessibility and reduced inequity (in terms of accessibility) across the city.},

  abstract = {We introduce a family of land use transportation interaction (LUTI) models which enable future employment, population and flows or trips between these activities to be explained and predicted. We begin by focusing on the generic spatial interaction model, noting the ways in which its components reflect demand and supply at different locations measured in terms of employment and working population. This suggests an equilibrium structure which is our starting point in developing a simplified version of the model which can be easily extended to deal with different sectors such as housing, retail activities, schools, and health facilities. We use this generic structure to develop four related versions of the models for residential populations, retailing, education and hospitals which are all driven by employment in terms of where people work and live. This constitutes our integrated framework that we use to calibrate the model to three urban areas or cities in Europe: to Oxford and its county, Turin and its region, and Athens in its hinterland of Attica reflecting population volumes from 700,000, 1.7 million and 3.8 million persons respectively. In each case, we use the models to predict the impact of different scenarios \textendash{} new housing developments in Oxfordshire, new universities and metro lines in Turin, and economic development in the Athens region. These scenarios show the versatility of using these models to examine such impacts and they also point to ways in which these models can be improved. We conclude with some directions for improving the various models and nesting them at different scales within the land use-transport planning process.},
