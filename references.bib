However, as an integral intervention to improve current transit services, it affects travel times and user costs entailing changes in accessibility. We developed a methodology to calculate these changes for different areas in the city, considering travel expenditure for work trips and socioeconomic features of the population. The paper evaluates accessibility implications for different fare schemes for the ITSB, modelling accessibility as a function of total travel expenditure and travel times. We focus on analysing changes in cost and trip distribution for ITSB routes and their impacts on access to employment. Changes in travel attributes are obtained from a four-step transport model of Bogota developed with VISUM modelling software. Meaningful changes in travel time and expenditure were found for all scenarios altering accessibility considerably. Under a flat fare scenario independent of travel distances, the number of transfers had a higher effect on accessibility in comparison to schemes where transfers are penalized through an incremental fare.},

  abstract = {The Metrocable in Medell\'in, Colombia, is an innovative system to improve access to deprived areas located in hilly zones. The idea to use cable cars as feeders to the metro was integrated into an ambitious urban project that, to date, has improved accessibility dramatically for some low-income residents. Using data before and after the project's implementation, we evaluate the impact on social equity for the population in the zone of influence, considering changes in accessibility to employment and in housing-related costs. The access provided by the project to the main high-employment centres has doubled the number of opportunities that can be reached by the ``target population,'' even though travel-time savings and costs have seen only small changes. In fact, prior access to the CBD was poor and expensive, but time and costs were reduced with the Metrocable, although this reduction was not equal for all locations in the metropolitan area. In general, we argue that the main benefits, in terms of accessibility that differentiates the areas analysed from those used for comparison, are related to a localised ease of access to specific centres of activity according to the centralised development of the city's job market along the mass transit lines. In terms of housing costs, we developed a set of difference-in-difference models that considered rent, transport, and public utilities costs; however, none of them have allowed us to conclude that there was a statistically valid relationship between the Metrocable and the changes in costs between the two analysed populations.},

  abstract = {Although the concept of social equity seems to be ubiquitous in most mobility plans of major Latin American cities, when evaluating transport projects for financing and prioritisation there are no specific or solid indicators to measure how they can contribute to promoting better access to opportunities, particularly for the most vulnerable segments of the population. In response, we designed a methodology that uses the concepts of accessibility and affordability as a complementary means for evaluating public transport investment, and identifying transport disadvantages and priorities for project generation. This is based on the calculation of accessibility levels to the labour market for different zones of a given city, by introducing a function of impedance composed by travel time budget and the percentage of income spent on transportation. The characteristics of time and percentage of income spent for accessing work obtained from transportation surveys define the ``real accessibility'' to employment for all the zones of a city. Then, a stated preference survey was applied in order to determine the desired expenditure in both variables, and the accessibility to jobs in this new situation was subsequently calculated. We calculated a third type of accessibility, using ``standard'' values of travel time and expenditure budget. This methodology is therefore used to evaluate different policies in Bogota, corresponding to changes in the fare structure of the existing public transport system, by proposing the development of cross subsidies, and carrying out an appraised on the impact of the development of a new Bus Rapid Transit line. The results show that depending on the population, its location and purchasing power, the impact of a redistributive fare with respect to accessibility to the labour market can be greater than the expansion and improvement of the public transport network.},

Lastly, the specific lessons learned from the author's fifteen-year experience developing and supporting a cellular urban growth and land use change model (SLEUTH) are shared, in the interest of making these issues generic to current and future modeling and simulation efforts. The conclusion stresses that future models face new computing power, new theoretical paradigms, vastly improved ways of visualizing simulations, and a rapidly changing audience for modeling and simulation.},

These large, city-wide transportation projects are often central to larger urban revitalization plans intending to foster economic growth and alter city images to both residents and to outsiders. Crucial to the success of such ambitions is a system that provides equitable access to all residents and one that provides access to a large number of urban opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to explore the spatial accessibility landscape created by newly implemented BRT system in Cali, Colombia in terms of both access to the system itself and access to three distinct activities around the city. In particular, the equitable distribution of accessibility patterns is explored in relation to neighborhood socio-economic strata. Findings indicate that walking access to the BRT system is greatest for middle income groups and most limited for neighborhoods in the highest and lowest socio-economic strata. Accessibility values to activities are largely bound to the spatial distribution pattern of activities; most equitable for intentionally dispersed recreation site, and least for spatially clustered hospitals.},

This paper is based on data collected over a period of time more than a year utilizing GPS devices. More than 18 million readings were collected corresponding to operational characteristics of car, taxi, motorcycle, truck and different modalities of public transport (UPT). The proposed methodology was applied through the mobility plan of the city of Manizales (Colombia) during the year of 2011. Manizales is a medium sized city with approximately 360.000 inhabitants, located in the central range of the Colombian mountains The average operating speed on each street network arc is the primary analysis variable; Geostatistical techniques are applied to predict the average travel time of each transportation mode . The results obtained are shown graphically and correspond to current city mobility data in a manner permitting comparison between transportation modes. It is concluded that the taxi mode of transportation with respect to accessibility provides better accessibility followed in corresponding order by motorcycle, car, truck and finally UPT; it has been determined that UPT provides the worst global accessibility media conditions; however, the UPT is the mode of transport most frequently used by the population (75\% of daily trips).},

Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or landuse and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial\textendash temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility.},

Rising interest on inclusive development of cities at different levels of urban policy involves new opportunities and challenges for increasingly urban societies. In cities of the Global South, in addition to institutional and physical challenges for the development of efficient and inclusive public transport, local governments face the challenge of making public transport affordable for a large share of the population in conditions of poverty. In order to meet these challenges, several public transport systems throughout have implemented targeted subsidies for specific social groups such as students, the elderly and people with reduced mobility, and more recently for the poor. The government of Bogot\'a has implemented a pro-poor public transport subsidy scheme that aims at alleviating the financial burden of poor households for accessing the city's public transport system. This research develops an analysis of the effects of such subsidy from an accessibility perspective using potential accessibility measures to employment opportunities and assess its impact on equity. The research builds on the hypothesis that accessibility is a multi-dimensional construct that can benefit from the decrease in economic as much as gains in time costs. Results from the analysis show that both the current structure of the pro-poor subsidies in Bogot\'a and alternative scenarios for increasing its coverage are progressive, improving accessibility and equity for those with access to the subsidy. The paper provides valuable insights for the analysis of similar policies in other urban contexts in the Global South.},

  abstract = {Social distancing and economic lockdown measures implemented in Global North countries have been mimicked in the Global South to contain the spread of COVID-19. However, the consequences of such measures on activity and mobility patterns among social groups in Global South cities remain unclear. This paper seeks to provide reliable evidence from changes in behaviors across income groups at the urban scale. We report a detailed analysis from a web-based survey to understand the effects of the early and complete lockdown adopted to contain the COVID-19 spread on activity and travel patterns in Bogot\'a. We also performed a geographical proximity analysis of non-work services and facilities located around surveyed households to challenge the rhetoric about the `15-minute' city. We found that low-income people are more socially exposed to contagion being forced to go out to find their daily sustenance and having adverse economic and travel effects than other income groups. However, even though Bogot\'a is not so far from meeting the goal of 15~min proximity, particularly for non-work-related activities, we found marked inequalities among income groups regarding access to essential services in proximity. The paper's findings serve as a reminder that travel behavior and accessibility are not the remits of only urban transport planning and that land-use and urban planning play a determining role in redressing social and spatial inequalities in a city.},

We estimated a hybrid discrete choice model for the new cable car service considering social capital as a latent variable and a stated preference survey issued before the cable car implementation. Social capital is measured through six domains associated with membership of civic groups, social networks, interpersonal trust, institutional trust, cooperation, and empowerment. Results suggest that the social capital stock in the influence zone of the cable car depends principally on age, sex, education level, and time living in the neighborhood. Results also show that higher social capital stocks are associated with a greater willingness to use the new cable car service, suggesting that social capital is a potential determinant for mode choice. Finally, we discuss implications for social capital and policymaking.},

  abstract = {Building occupancy, which reflects occupant presence, movements and activities within the building space, is a key factor to consider in building energy modelling and simulation. Characterising complex occupant behaviours and their determinants poses challenges from the sensing, modelling, interpretation and prediction perspectives. Past studies typically applied time-dependent models to predict regular occupancy patterns for commercial buildings. However, this prevalent reliance on purely time-of-day effects is typically not sufficient to accurately characterise the complex occupancy patterns as they may vary with building's surrounding conditions, i.e. the urban environment. Therefore, this paper proposes a conceptual framework to incorporate the interactions between urban systems and building occupancy. Under the framework, we propose a novel modelling methodology relying on competing risk hazard formulation to analyse the occupancy of a case study building in London, UK. The occupancy profiles were inferred from the Wi-Fi connection logs extracted from the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure. When compared with the conventional discrete-time Markov Chain Model (MCM), the hazard-based modelling approach was able to better capture the duration dependent nature of the transition probabilities as well as incorporate and quantify the influence of the local environment on occupancy transitions. The work has demonstrated that this approach enables a convenient and flexible incorporation of urban dependencies leading to accurate occupancy predictions whilst providing the ability to interpret the impacts of urban systems on building occupancy.},

Less attention has been devoted to identifying the practical conditions under which big data can realistically contribute to addressing urban policy problems. In this paper, we discuss the value and limitations of big data for long-term urban policy and planning. We first develop a theoretical perspective on urban analytics as a practice that is part of a new smart urbanism. We identify the particular tension of opposed temporalities of high-frequency data and the long dur\'ee of structural challenges facing cities. Drawing on empirical studies using big urban data, we highlight epistemological and practical challenges that arise from the analysis of high-frequency data for strategic purposesand formulate propositions on the ways in which urban analytics can inform long-term urban policy.},

  abstract = {The achievement of good spatial accessibility and equity in the distribution of urban services is one of the supreme goals for urban planners. With Scottish Government backing, the City of Edinburgh Council (CEC) has started to construct a tram network to cater for the future needs of Scotland's capital city by providing an integrated transport solution using trams and buses. Spatial Network Analysis of Public Transport Accessibility (SNAPTA) which is a GIS-based accessibility model has been developed to measure the accessibility by public transport to different urban services and activities. The model responds to several limitations in other existing accessibility models in planning practice. It offers an alternative and practical tool to help planners and decision makers in examining the strengths and weaknesses of land use \textendash{} transport integration. SNAPTA has been applied to a pilot study in Edinburgh city to identify the contribution of the infrastructure improvements of the tram system and Edinburgh South Suburban Railway (ESSR) to improved accessibility by public transport to six types of activity opportunities. This paper outlines the concept and methodology of the SNAPTA model, and presents the findings related to this pilot study with a focus on changes in potential accessibility to jobs between four different public transport network scenarios. The accessibility values so obtained help to identify the gaps in the coverage of the public transport network and the efficiency in the spatial distribution of urban services and activities. The findings focus on whether the planned transport infrastructures for Edinburgh will lead to better accessibility and reduced inequity (in terms of accessibility) across the city.},

Building on previously introduced concepts and software prototypes, we have been designing a dynamic computational modeling platform for studying the integrated effects of supply side and demand side technologies and policies to reduce environmental impacts and consumption of resources caused by activities in urban ecosystems such as Tokyo, Japan. This platform has been used to evaluate scenarios that include the introduction of roof-top photovoltaics, a solid oxide fuel cell combined with a gas turbine topping cycle (SOFC/GT), energy conservation measures in the residential and commercial building sectors, and waste processing and recycling systems. Here we describe the software engineering issues associated with the construction of this model integration platform and provide examples of the techniques we have developed to address those issues.},

  abstract = {We introduce a family of land use transportation interaction (LUTI) models which enable future employment, population and flows or trips between these activities to be explained and predicted. We begin by focusing on the generic spatial interaction model, noting the ways in which its components reflect demand and supply at different locations measured in terms of employment and working population. This suggests an equilibrium structure which is our starting point in developing a simplified version of the model which can be easily extended to deal with different sectors such as housing, retail activities, schools, and health facilities. We use this generic structure to develop four related versions of the models for residential populations, retailing, education and hospitals which are all driven by employment in terms of where people work and live. This constitutes our integrated framework that we use to calibrate the model to three urban areas or cities in Europe: to Oxford and its county, Turin and its region, and Athens in its hinterland of Attica reflecting population volumes from 700,000, 1.7 million and 3.8 million persons respectively. In each case, we use the models to predict the impact of different scenarios \textendash{} new housing developments in Oxfordshire, new universities and metro lines in Turin, and economic development in the Athens region. These scenarios show the versatility of using these models to examine such impacts and they also point to ways in which these models can be improved. We conclude with some directions for improving the various models and nesting them at different scales within the land use-transport planning process.},

  abstract = {Introduction This paper examines the links between perceived liveability and mental health, questioning the role transport-related variables and features of the built environment play in the relationship between the two concepts. By exploring a topic not often tackled from the perspective of transport and health studies, the paper positions the concept of perceived liveability as a mechanism to capture the subjective interpretations of the built environment by residents of different socioeconomic backgrounds and mobility behaviours. Methods The paper uses Cali, Colombia as an example of a rapidly growing city in the global South. We analyse data collected from an online participatory planning instrument where over 300 participants responded to questions on their mental health and their perceptions of the built environment, urban design, access to leisure facilities, and so forth. We use a Structural Equations Model that incorporates mental health and perceived liveability as latent variables. The paper also draws from secondary data to map both the spatial distribution of the various determinants of perceived liveability as well as the scores of the two latent constructs analysed. Results We demonstrate that perceived liveability can be expressed as a latent variable, causing scores and correlations in measured variables associated with the urban form, the environment, access to transport, and fear of crime. On the whole, higher liveability scores are linked with higher mental health scores, and car users tend to score higher in both perceived liveability and mental health scores. Conclusions There are meaningful links between perceived liveability and mental health influenced by transport-related drivers such as mode choice. Findings concerning car users suggest that transport investments in cities like Cali tend to accommodate already socio-economically advantaged residents. When testing our hypothesis that proximity to mass transit infrastructure could increase liveability, the results were inconclusive, which suggests a limited ``liveability footprint'' of public transport infrastructure.},

Despite the resurgence of BRT, there is a world-wide paucity of research examining its ability to spur and development. By estimating spatial hedonic price functions, the paper determines the extent to which access to BRT stations in Bogot\'a, Colombia, currently are capitalized into land values. Results suggest that for every 5 min of additional walking time to a BRT station, the rental price of a property decreases by between 6.8 and 9.3\%, after controlling for structural characteristics, neighbourhood attributes and proximity to the BRT corridor. Evaluated at the average walking time to a BRT station, this effect translates into an elasticity of between - 0.16 and - 0.22. Although these estimates cannot be attributable directly to the presence of the BRT system because a cross-sectional design is used, they suggest that the land market in Bogot\'a values access to BRT station locations.}

Our conceptualizations of space, being culturally regulated, must diverge in some ways from that of other cultures. Does it then make sense that taking the same geographic region that an indigenous mapmaker would produce a different map than a mapmaker from the culture with a scientific tradition? How do we account for these differences, i.e., the development of different schemas? Are we able to use a tool such as GIS, based on a scientific paradigm, to create the representations of space that are derived from different cultural schemas?

Finally, the potential for more effective deployment of models in city planning is shown with a system that combines data assembly, modelling and interactive planning.},
