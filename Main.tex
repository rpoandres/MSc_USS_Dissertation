\chapter{Introduction} \label{Chap1}

\section{Background}

- . 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Lack of functioning metro system in Bogota although it has been proposed and mention in previous local and/or national government plans
    \begin{itemize}
      \item  For dimensions reference, mention bogotas demographics data.
    \end{itemize}
  \item How it contribute or prevent people to have better life quality
\end{itemize}

\section{Importance}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Provide technical tools to assess transport planning decision
  \item Baseline reference for future or similar transport public policy decision making
  \item Assess how the metro system designs address the accessibility of the inhabitants
  \item Spatial reference for future local government intervention and investment decisions from the private sector
  \item Why is accessibility important in a economic and urban context? How can it drive growth?
  \item How it contribute or prevent people to have better life quality
\end{itemize}

\section{Research question}

The present research aims to address:
\begin{center}
    \textit{How would the public transportation accessibility spatially vary with the construction of Bogot\'{a}\textquotesingle s future metro system?}
\end{center}
